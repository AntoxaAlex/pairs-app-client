## Answers
1. I didn't have any problem with API endpoint, but, on my opinion, response could be more complete(f.e. some extra data about trends and other important market indicators).
2. I was unsure of serving requests to given API and keeping secret data in client part. But I solved it by deploying my own node.js server on heroku.
3. The time constraints were accurate, but I faced with problems, which stole more time than I expected.
4. I think,I would not change anything
